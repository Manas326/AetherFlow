This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline for AI-driven network security: data capture, preprocessing, feature extraction, ML anomaly detection (baseline + advanced models), explainability, and a simple dashboard to visualise alerts and run automated responses.  It is designed for learning, demonstration, and portfolio use in interviews.
